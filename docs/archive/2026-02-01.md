## What Happened

### Agentic Coding: Problem Solving Meets Code  
A new article on *Towards Data Science* explains *agentic coding*, a style where AI agents not only generate code but execute and respond interactively to problem states. This approach leverages AI as a collaborator, increasing coding efficiency and adaptability.

### Claude Code on Your Machine, Free  
Ollama’s integration makes it easier than ever to run Claude’s AI models locally or in the cloud without fees, broadening access to Claude’s language capabilities beyond hosted APIs.

### NVIDIA’s Big Moves in Robotics & Autonomous Tech  
Mercedes-Benz unveiled an S-Class equipped with NVIDIA’s DRIVE AV, designed for L4 autonomy, marking a crucial step toward production self-driving cars. Meanwhile, NVIDIA introduced *Cosmos Policy* on Hugging Face, a framework allowing developers to design advanced robot control policies with AI.

### LangChain & Hugging Face: Evolving Developer Tools  
LangChain’s latest newsletter details significant improvements in managing context for deep AI agents, helping build more reliable and context-aware applications. Hugging Face dropped *Daggr*, a visual tool to chain and inspect AI apps programmatically, simplifying development and debugging.

### OpenAI Retires Older GPT-4 Variants  
OpenAI announced the retirement of GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and other legacy ChatGPT models to streamline resources towards the latest architectures, signaling a shift toward more powerful and efficient models.

## Why It Matters

- **Agentic coding** is shaping how AI can augment developers, turning AI from a passive assistant into an active problem solver that iterates on solutions in real-time. This could drastically speed up prototyping and debugging.
  
- **Free access to Claude code** on local machines lowers the barrier to exploring and customizing AI models, which is crucial for experimenting in privacy-sensitive or offline environments.

- NVIDIA’s **robotics and autonomous vehicle platforms** are pushing AI from research toward real-world impact, influencing industries from automotive to manufacturing automation.

- Enhanced **tooling from LangChain and Hugging Face** supports building sophisticated AI agents and workflows with improved context control and transparency—key for deploying reliable AI in production.

- OpenAI’s model retirements remind us that **AI infrastructure evolves quickly**, and staying up-to-date ensures access to the best performance and capabilities.

## Try This Today

1. **Experiment with agentic coding:** Follow the Towards Data Science tutorial to build a small agent that can iteratively solve a coding problem by writing and running code. Observe how the AI’s problem-solving strategy adapts.

2. **Run Claude locally:** Use Ollama’s free tools to set up Claude on your laptop or cloud environment. Explore customizing Claude prompts without relying on external APIs.

3. **Explore LangChain’s new context management:** If you build multi-step AI workflows, review LangChain’s latest methods to maintain context and state for deep agents, improving reliability over longer sessions.

4. **Visual chaining with Daggr:** Try Hugging Face’s Daggr to programmatically combine small AI apps into complex pipelines. Debug visually to understand data flow and interactions.

## Teaching Angle

- Use *agentic coding* as a case study to teach AI-driven software development, emphasizing the collaboration between human logic and AI experimentation.
- Introduce *local model running* (like Claude on Ollama) in privacy or edge-computing lessons, highlighting differences from cloud-based AI.
- Showcase NVIDIA’s open robotics frameworks to illustrate how AI integrates with physical systems, reinforcing AI’s role beyond traditional software.
- Highlight the importance of **context management** in language models, demonstrating practical ways to handle memory and long conversations in AI apps.
- Discuss the lifecycle of AI models and infrastructure changes, using OpenAI’s deprecation announcements to motivate continuous learning in AI deployments.
