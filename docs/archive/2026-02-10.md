# What Happened

**Google’s Shift From Everything Prompts**  
Google is evolving beyond the “everything prompt” era in AI, moving toward structured prompt formats to better control AI outputs. This means designing well-defined input schemas rather than relying on free-form text prompts alone.

**Transformers.js v4 Release**  
Hugging Face previewed their new Transformers.js v4 library, now available on NPM. It allows lightweight, efficient transformer model inference directly in browsers or Node.js, opening doors for web apps using state-of-the-art NLP models without server dependence.

**OpenAI Testing Ads Inside ChatGPT**  
OpenAI announced initial experiments with displaying advertisements inside ChatGPT. This represents a shift to diversify revenue models beyond API usage and subscriptions, raising questions about user experience and data privacy.

# Why It Matters

- **Structured prompting** improves AI model reliability, critical for teaching and building reliable applications. It reduces ambiguity common in free-text prompts, helping avoid unexpected or off-topic responses.
  
- **On-device transformer inference** through Transformers.js empowers developers to build faster, privacy-friendly AI apps without constant API calls — a huge advantage for demos, prototypes, and real-world deployments.
  
- **Ads in ChatGPT** could change how AI chatbots are funded and accessed. While ads might lower barriers to entry with free access tiers, instructors and practitioners must think critically about the implications on user focus, data use, and bot behavior.

# Try This Today

- **Experiment with structured prompts:** Pick a simple NLP task (e.g., summarization or classification) and compare free-text prompts with a structured prompt format (such as JSON or templated inputs). Note differences in output quality and consistency.
  
- **Deploy a small transformer model in your browser:** Install `transformers` and `transformers.js` from NPM and run a demo sentiment analysis or question-answering model inside a web page to see inference speed and simplicity firsthand.
  
- **Evaluate ad presence in AI interactions:** If you use ChatGPT or similar services, note how ads (if available) affect your engagement. Reflect on settings where ads might disrupt vs. add value.

# Teaching Angle

**Focus on Prompt Engineering Evolution**  
With Google’s move toward structured AI, emphasize the importance of carefully defining AI inputs beyond freeform prompts. Introduce learners to prompt engineering as a design problem — balancing flexibility with constraints.

**Hands-on with Web AI**  
Use Transformers.js in classroom or workshops to demystify how AI models can run locally in browsers — highlighting privacy, efficiency, and accessibility benefits compared to cloud-only models.

**Discuss AI Monetization Roadmaps**  
Foster open conversations on monetization strategies like ads and subscriptions in AI tools. What trade-offs exist for users, developers, and society? Encourage critical thinking about sustainable AI ecosystems.
